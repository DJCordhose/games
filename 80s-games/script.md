Games from the 80ies in less than 100 lines of code
===================================================
In this slide-less talk we will develop a few game ideas from the eighties in JavaScript.
We will start from scratch and see how easy it is to sketch basic games ideas in the browser using the canvas.
You can learn about a game loop, collision detection, sound in the browser and how all this relates to the latest hype
of reactive programming. If you want to, this can also be a highly interactive session.

Why?
----
This mainly is a fun talk. It shows how easy it is to create a simple browser game where the game idea is key instead of fancy graphics.
People can start creating their own games right away by cloning https://github.com/DJCordhose/games. I have done previous
versions of this talks at the Hamburg and Berlin JavaScript meetup and it has been fun both times. Will also have this
talk at http://2014.jsunconf.eu/ and have a coding convention based on it http://attending.io/events/games-from-the-80s-jam



20-45 minutes talk
------------------
0. Explain idea and lib
1. balls

More games?
* Snake
* Tetris
* Pong

* PNGs and collision detection for them (bounding box?)

Or rather game variations?
