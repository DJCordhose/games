Basics of JavaScript Canvas Game Development
============================================

In this live coding sessions I will introduce you to the basics of JavaScript and Canvas game development.
We will do something like this little game (http://zeigermann.eu/balls/) more or less from scratch.

Topics will include canvas basics, game loop, player control, physics, and game logic.

20-25 minutes talk
------------------
0. Introduction and Explain game idea (2 min)
   * Show game
   * Strategies:
     * Go slow, easily avoid red balls
     * Be fast, collect many green balls before there even are that many red ones
1. Canvas (3 min)
   * Show and explain can canvas.js
2. Loop (3 min)
3. Control (3 min)
4. Physics (4 min)
5. Logic (3 min)
6. The complete Ball Game / Summary (2 min)
7. Possible extensions (ad lib)
   * No direct collision of newly created red ball
   * Pause
   * Local high scores
   * Variable FPS and delta times
   * Snake like tail (must be avoided)
   * Moving pray (green) balls
   * (Moving) Barriers (elastic collision)
